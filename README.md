# Hotel-reservation-system
Sunny Beach hotel offers a number of facilities to guests. The owner of the hotel would like a new website. 

The website should provide a number of functionalities to guests and managers. For example, guests should be able to register, search for available rooms and make reservations for a specific period of time. Guests should also be able to sign in to their account and check their current and previous reservations. In addition to those functionalities for guests, managers should be able to sign in to their account, view reserved rooms by guests, search for available rooms, retrieve a guestâ€™s details, and modify the details of guests and rooms.
